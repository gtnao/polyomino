## Key Improvements

1. **Clear Separation**: Technical docs (ARCHITECTURE) vs gameplay docs (GAMEPLAY) vs practical guides (CLAUDE)

2. **Task-Oriented Navigation**: INDEX.md provides "I want to..." navigation

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 
   - Players have full gameplay documentation
   - Developers have both practical and technical guides
   - Easy to find information based on need

4. **Future-Proof Structure**:
   - Easy to add new documentation
   - Clear places for different types of information
   - Scalable organization

## Usage Recommendations

- **New Developers**: Start with README → CLAUDE → ARCHITECTURE
- **Players**: Read README → GAMEPLAY
- **Contributors**: Use docs/INDEX to find specific information
- **Maintainers**: ARCHITECTURE for system changes, CLAUDE for workflows

This documentation structure provides a solid foundation for future development while making the project more accessible to new contributors.
